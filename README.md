# Horiseon-Digital-Marketing

This is the updated Horiseon website. This website has been updated to reflect modern semantics and acessability. I did this by renaming some of the elements and classes, and making it easier to edit and access code that was pre-written on the style.css page and index.css page. This was done by simply adding header, footer, article, aside, etc. These changes make it easier to edit and the code for future updates.

Files created 
    - index.html
    - style.css
